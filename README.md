# Hi, I'm Isaac

I'm a developer who mostly works around the web at both ends. I love open source and am trying to contribute to new projects. I'm fully self taught and I love learning about new technologies. I'm currently very interested in functional programming and concurrent systems.

I'm trying to spend a bit less time on social media and big companies websites, so if you'd like to see some of my personal stuff, it's over on [the isaac zone](https://isaac.zone)

If you're looking for a website - particularly for a Minecraft server as that's been my jam for some time - check out [Graphite Creative](https://grphcrtv.com)

This is a file in a monorepo where I'm going to start collecting little snippets and explorations into new projects before moving them into their own repo or getting rid of them.
