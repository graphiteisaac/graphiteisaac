# Hi, I'm Isaac

I'm a developer who mostly works around the web at both ends. I love open source and am trying to contribute to new projects. I'm fully self taught and I love learning about new technologies. I'm currently very interested in functional programming and concurrent systems. I've done extensive work in the web world, especially with TypeScript, Vue, some React, Go, and Gleam. Gleam is my favourite tool to use whenever I can! I also maintain the bots for the Overwatch Discord community.

I'm trying to spend a bit less time on social media and big tech spaces, so if you'd like to see some of my personal stuff, it's over on [the isaac zone](https://isaac.zone)

If you're looking for a website - particularly for a gaming community, as that's been my jam for some time - check out [Graphite Creative](https://grphcrtv.com)
